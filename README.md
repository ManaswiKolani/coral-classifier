## 🌊 About the Project

This interactive app uses:
- 🧠 **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
- ⚙️ **TensorFlow** and **Keras** for training and prediction
- 🎛️ **Adam optimizer** for adaptive learning
- 🎨 **Streamlit** for the web UI
- 🐍 **Python** for all back-end logic and data handling

Upload a coral photo and receive a prediction with confidence, model interpretation, and architecture overview.

## 🌐 Background: Why Coral Bleaching Matters

Coral reefs are critical ecosystems that host thousands of marine species. But climate change, especially rising ocean temperatures, can disrupt their balance.

A temperature increase of just 2°F can cause corals to expel the algae (zooxanthellae) that give them nutrients and color, resulting in **coral bleaching**. Bleached corals are more vulnerable to disease, struggle to reproduce, and can die without recovery.

Coral reefs protect coastlines from storms, support biodiversity, and generate billions in tourism. Their loss impacts wildlife, food security, coastal safety, and economies.  

Coral bleaching is preventable. Local actions like reducing pollution and fertilizer runoff help. But the global driver is **climate change**, and even small increases in ocean temperature can trigger mass bleaching.

Bleached reefs are vulnerable and may never recover. Without intervention, reef ecosystems collapse, affecting species survival, livelihoods, and global biodiversity.
